# resume-parser
This project is the precursor to the resume-parser-python project. This project is currently abandoned due to insufficent PDF libraries, as golang PDF libraries seems to have issues with permissions and encodings of PDFs. This code should still work however just not as consistently as with the python version. 

Usage:

> resume_parser.exe -p path to PDF directory -k path to keywords file -o path to output directory
